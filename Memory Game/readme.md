# Match'em! 

A recreated card-matching game by Lane Harper using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

This is a pretty simple game, so running it should only require opening the HTML file within a browser(works best on Chrome) and making sure you have the entire file running locally so that it can use the assets included. All CDNs are linked in the HTML file, so the font icons and SweetAlert box should all work fine. 

### Prerequisites

A computer, internet connection, knowledge of how to download files, and the strange desire to match different cards for fun. If you intend to alter or edit the code, you'll need a code editor of some sort. I used VS Code to develop this! 

### Installing

Simply download the Memory Game folder, and run the index.html file in a web browser. If you have the full directory, everything should run fine. If you don't have internet connection, the icons and end modal will not load as they are linked from the internet. 

## Built With

HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Also used [SweetAlert](https://sweetalert.js.org/) for the game-over modal. Code editor used is VSCode as it is my preferred editor, but any code editor will work if you decide to change anything. A CSS prefixer was also utilized.

## Authors

Udacity supplied the starter HTML and CSS3 files, but I altered them to my own tastes for this project, in order to have a more unique feel. The actual JavaScript was written 100% by me, and was pretty tricky if I'm being honest. 

## License(?) 

I created this as part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program, and it is meant solely for entertainment/portfolio/educational purposes. I do not claim to have created the matching game itself, as games like that have been around for years. I simply created the code to control the flipping of cards, the scoring system, the timer, the overall performance of the game, etc. Icons are courtesy of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com). [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/) utilized for the modal box at the end of the game.
